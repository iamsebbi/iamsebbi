/**
 * Typography Utilities with Clamp System
 * 
 * The clamp-based typography system is now active!
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * - All Tailwind text size classes (text-xs, text-sm, text-xl, etc.) now use clamp()
 * - Font sizes automatically scale smoothly between min and max values based on viewport width
 * - No need for multiple responsive classes - one class handles all screen sizes
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * Before: <h1 className="text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl">Title</h1>
 * After:  <h1 className="text-5xl">Title</h1> (automatically scales!)
 * 
 * You can still use responsive classes if you need different sizes at breakpoints,
 * but the clamp system provides smooth scaling without breakpoints.
 * 
 * CUSTOMIZATION:
 * Edit the CSS variables in src/styles/index.css to adjust the min/max values
 * for each font size.
